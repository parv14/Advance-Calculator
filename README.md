Project Title: Advanced Calculator with Expression Evaluation
Description:
Developed a sophisticated calculator application in Python that extends the functionality of a simple calculator to handle complex mathematical expressions. This project demonstrates proficiency in object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithm implementation.
Key Features and Implementations:

Expression Tokenization:

Implemented a tokenizer to convert string expressions into a list of tokens, distinguishing between numeric operands and operators.
Handled both integer and floating-point numbers.


Bracket Validation:

Developed a robust algorithm to check the validity of brackets in expressions.
Ensured proper nesting and matching of parentheses and curly braces.
Implemented special rules, such as allowing only parentheses within curly braces.


Complex Expression Evaluation:

Created an algorithm to evaluate mathematical expressions with multiple operations and nested brackets.
Implemented operator precedence (multiplication and division before addition and subtraction).
Handled parentheses and curly braces for expression grouping.


Error Handling:

Implemented comprehensive error checking for invalid expressions.
Handled division by zero and other mathematical errors.


History Tracking:

Maintained a history of evaluated expressions and their results.
Implemented functionality to retrieve the calculation history.


Object-Oriented Design:

Utilized inheritance to extend a SimpleCalculator class, demonstrating OOP principles.
Encapsulated functionality within well-defined methods.


Data Structure Utilization:

Employed a custom Stack class for bracket matching and expression evaluation.



Technical Implementation:

Programming Language: Python
Key Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures (Stack), Algorithm Design
Methods Implemented:

tokenize(): Converts string expressions to token lists.
check_brackets(): Validates bracket placement and nesting.
evaluate_list_tokens(): Core algorithm for expression evaluation.
